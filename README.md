> This starter kit is for 10x developers only. If you are not a 10x developer, please leave this repo immediately.

LaraOverkill is an elite starter kit for elite developers. It includes the most advanced technologies your project needs to be successful. It comes batteries included with the following features:
- React
- Typescript
- GraphQL
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui

## Installation

This starter kit should only be used for project ideas that are expected to have thousands of concurrent users. 

Once your billion dollar idea is ready to be deployed, follow these steps to get started:

1. Open NeoVim

If you already don't have NeoVim installed, you are not a true 10x developer and your project idea will not produce a billion dollars. Stop now.


2. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tcampbPPU/LaraOverkill.git
```

3. Install composer dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

4. Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

6. Generate an application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

7. Compile assets

```bash
npm run dev
```

8. Start the development server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## TL;DR

If your time is too valuable to read the installation instructions, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tcampbPPU/LaraOverkill.git; composer install; npm install; cp .env.example .env; php artisan key:generate; npm run dev; php artisan serve
```
